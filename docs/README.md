## About CLIProxyAPI

CLIProxyAPI is a proxy server that wraps various AI services (OpenAI, Claude, Qwen, etc.) and presents them as an OpenAI-compatible API service.

The enhanced configuration system provides:

- Advanced security with SOPS encryption
- Comprehensive monitoring and dashboard
- Automated backup and recovery
- Performance tuning and optimization
- Security hardening measures
- Easy management through the `cliproxyapi-manager` command
